from what I gathered on codecademy, we are going to try to use the skype api to make a chat application.

i havn't had time to read all the documentation on that, but I think another thing we could do is make a websocket

if we can find a server that will accept python script then making a websocket shouldn't be too hard

anybody know of any servers that'll let us upload python?

I know a good company that does shared and dedicated servers and hosting, I need the following details to estimate the cost or to see 
or to see if they could possibly put an old server online for us for free:

what are minimun requirements for :

processor
RAM
HDD
do we need RAID on it? (gets quite expensive)
OS (ubuntu has a free server OS)
how much throughput ? 


Also I was thinking that we should make a list of funtionality we would like to add to teh chat applet. 
Make maybe a flowhart of the process or simply plan it out? so we dont run around like chickens with their head cut off :P
