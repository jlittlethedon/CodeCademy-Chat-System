from what I gathered on codecademy, we are going to try to use the skype api to make a chat application.

i havn't had time to read all the documentation on that, but I think another thing we could do is make a websocket

if we can find a server that will accept python script then making a websocket shouldn't be too hard

anybody know of any servers that'll let us upload python?
