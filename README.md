# Setting up a development server

I recommend using VirtualBox (free: https://www.virtualbox.org/) to host your virtual machine.

I am using Ubuntu server 13.04 for my server, but if you aren't that familiar with the command line, you should probably use the desktop version of Ubuntu in a virtual machine.

You can create a new virtual machine by installing the OS on VirtualBox yourself, or download a premade VM (here: http://virtualboxes.org/images/) and boot it up. Now you'll have a linux environment in which to host our Python chat server!
